# wine_strategic_pricing
This project on Red wine quality will examine physicochemical inputs to identify empirical (if any) support for a relation between the price of wine and its quality. Price is defined under the connotation of being strategic and not the literal price of a particular wine as it is absent in the dataset. Kaggle is the source of physicochemical and sensory data. Following the results of this study we hope to answer questions regarding strategic price setting possibilities (e.g. Which combinations of materials would yield quality sensory results to a customer). Reasoning for this topic selection stems from a curiosity to whether we owe wine quality to brand reputation.
